## FOUNDATIONAL THEORY

### Card Advantage (Brian Weissman, 1996)
The player with more cards is more likely to win. This is the most fundamental principle of Magic theory.
- **Drawing cards** = gaining advantage (Ancestral Recall, Brainstorm)
- **2-for-1s** = removing multiple threats with one card (board wipes, Cryptic Command)
- **Virtual card advantage** = making opponent's cards irrelevant (Moat blanks all ground creatures)
- **Card quality** matters as much as quantity

### Tempo
The efficient use of mana and time to establish board presence and pressure.
- Missing a land drop or failing to spend mana = falling behind on tempo
- Tempo-positive plays: casting threats that cost less than the answers needed to remove them
- Tempo vs Card Advantage is the fundamental tension in Magic

### Mana Curve (Jay Schneider/Sligh, 1996)
Maximizing the probability of using all available mana each turn.

**Standard Aggressive Curve (60-card, turn 5 format):**
- 1-drops: 8-12
- 2-drops: 8-12  
- 3-drops: 6-8
- 4-drops: 2-4
- Lands: 20-24

**Midrange Curve:**
- 1-drops: 4-8 (often removal/interaction)
- 2-drops: 6-10
- 3-drops: 8-12
- 4-drops: 6-8
- 5+ drops: 2-6
- Lands: 24-26

**Control Curve:**
- 1-2 drops: 8-12 (mostly interaction)
- 3-4 drops: 8-12
- 5+ finishers: 2-6
- Lands: 26-28

### Who's the Beatdown (Mike Flores, 1999)
In every matchup, one player must be the aggressor (beatdown) and one must be the defender (control).
- **"Misassignment of role = game loss"**
- The deck that will win if the game goes long should play control
- The deck that will lose if the game goes long must be the beatdown
- Roles can shift mid-game based on board state

### Inevitability (Zvi Mowshowitz)
A deck has inevitability when its win percentage increases as the game lengthens.
- Control decks typically have inevitability over aggro
- Combo decks can have inevitability over control (they will eventually assemble the combo)
- Ramp decks gain inevitability through mana advantage

## DECK ARCHETYPES

### The Rock-Paper-Scissors Triangle
- **Aggro beats Control** (faster than control can stabilize)
- **Control beats Combo** (disrupts key pieces)
- **Combo beats Aggro** (ignores creature combat)

### Primary Archetypes

**AGGRO**
- Win fast through creature damage
- Low mana curve (peaks at 1-2)
- Minimal interaction, maximum threats
- Examples: Sligh, Red Deck Wins, White Weenie, Burn
- Key principle: Every card should deal damage or enable damage

**CONTROL**
- Win through attrition and card advantage
- High land count, expensive finishers
- Answers > Threats ratio
- Examples: The Deck, UW Control, Draw-Go
- Key principle: Trade 1-for-1 until you can deploy an unanswerable threat

**COMBO**
- Win through synergistic card combinations
- Tutors, card selection, protection
- Often ignores opponent's gameplan
- Examples: Splinter Twin, Storm, Reanimator
- Key principle: Consistency in assembling the combo

**MIDRANGE**
- Hybrid of aggro and control
- Efficient threats + quality removal
- Flexible role assignment
- Examples: Jund, The Rock, Golgari Midrange
- Key principle: Go bigger than aggro, go under control

**TEMPO**
- Aggro-Control hybrid
- Cheap threats + cheap disruption
- Clock + protection
- Examples: Delver, Faeries, Spirits
- Key principle: Establish early threat, protect it while disrupting opponent

**RAMP**
- Accelerate mana to cast expensive threats early
- Mana dorks, land search, cost reduction
- Examples: Tron, Valakut, Green Devotion
- Key principle: Reach critical mana threshold before opponent's gameplan executes

## DECK CONSTRUCTION PRINCIPLES

### The Rule of 9
A consistent 60-card deck should have approximately 9 different cards, with 4 copies of each (36 cards) plus 24 lands. This maximizes consistency.

### Threat Density
- Aggro: 28-32 threats, 4-8 interaction
- Midrange: 16-24 threats, 8-12 interaction
- Control: 4-8 threats, 24-28 interaction
- Combo: Core combo pieces + enablers + protection

### Removal Suite Construction
Consider what threats you need to answer:
- Small creatures (1-3 mana): cheap removal (Fatal Push, Shock)
- Large creatures: unconditional removal (Murder, Path to Exile)
- Noncreature permanents: flexible answers (Abrade, Assassin's Trophy)
- Wide boards: sweepers (Wrath of God, Anger of the Gods)
- Build your removal suite to match the expected metagame

### Mana Base Construction (Frank Karsten's Guidelines)
For consistent turn-X casting:
- 1-drop: 14+ sources of that color
- 2-drop: 13+ sources
- 3-drop: 12+ sources
- Double-pip (CC): 20+ sources
- Triple-pip (CCC): 24+ sources

**Land Count by Deck Type:**
- Aggro (curve tops at 3): 20-22 lands
- Midrange: 24-25 lands
- Control: 26-27 lands
- Ramp: 24-26 lands + mana acceleration

### Sideboard Construction (15 cards)
- 3-4 cards for worst matchup
- 2-3 cards for second worst matchup
- 2-3 cards for third worst matchup
- 4-5 flexible cards for medium matchups
- Avoid cards that are dead in multiple matchups

**Common Sideboard Categories:**
- Graveyard hate (Soul-Guide Lantern, Rest in Peace)
- Artifact/Enchantment removal (Disenchant, Nature's Claim)
- Additional counterspells vs control/combo
- Sweepers vs aggro/tokens
- Lifegain vs burn
- Planeswalker answers

## SYNERGY VS POWER

### Good Stuff Decks
- Play the most powerful individual cards
- Less vulnerable to hate cards
- Consistent but predictable
- Example: Jund Midrange

### Synergy Decks
- Cards become powerful through interaction
- Higher ceiling, lower floor
- Vulnerable to disruption of key pieces
- Example: Affinity, Dredge, Enchantress

### The Best Decks
The greatest decks in Magic history combine raw power with synergy:
- Affinity: Powerful artifacts that make each other better
- Caw-Blade: Stoneforge + Equipment + Squadron Hawk
- Splinter Twin: Combo finish in a tempo shell

## METAGAME ANALYSIS

### Reading a Metagame
1. Identify Tier 1 decks (>10% metagame share)
2. Understand what beats Tier 1
3. Identify hate cards seeing play
4. Find unexploited weaknesses

### Positioning Your Deck
- **Ahead of the metagame**: Play what beats the best deck
- **Part of the metagame**: Play the best deck with good sideboard
- **Rogue**: Find an angle nobody is preparing for

### Format Speed
- **Fast formats**: Aggro and combo dominate, games end by turn 4-5
- **Medium formats**: Midrange thrives, games end by turn 6-8
- **Slow formats**: Control and value decks dominate

## FAMOUS DECK LESSONS

### The Deck (Weissman, 1994-1996)
- Card advantage wins games
- You only need one or two win conditions
- 28 lands was revolutionary when others played 20

### Sligh (Schneider/Sligh, 1996)
- Mana curve is fundamental
- Cheap cards have value all game
- Redundancy = consistency

### Necro (1996)
- Life is a resource
- Card advantage at any cost
- Only the last point of life matters

### Affinity (2004)
- Synergy can break formats
- Fast mana is always dangerous
- The best deck warps everything around it

### Caw-Blade (2011)
- Equipment + creatures = value engine
- Flexible threats that provide card advantage
- Planeswalkers as must-answer threats

### Jund (2009-present)
- The template for modern midrange
- Efficient threats + efficient answers
- Bloodbraid Elf = the perfect midrange card

## PRACTICAL DECK BUILDING PROCESS

### Step 1: Identify Your Strategy
- What is your primary win condition?
- What turn do you want to win by?
- Are you proactive (deploying threats) or reactive (answering threats)?

### Step 2: Core Cards (16-20 cards)
- 4-ofs that define the deck
- Your best cards that you want every game

### Step 3: Supporting Cast (12-16 cards)
- Cards that enable your core
- Synergy pieces
- Secondary threats

### Step 4: Interaction (8-12 cards)
- Removal that matches your curve and metagame
- Protection for your threats
- Counterspells if in blue

### Step 5: Mana Base (20-27 lands)
- Untapped sources for early plays
- Color fixing for multicolor
- Utility lands that don't cost too much tempo

### Step 6: Refinement
- Goldfish hands (no opponent)
- Test against gauntlet of top decks
- Adjust numbers based on performance
- Build sideboard to shore up weaknesses

## WHEN BUILDING FROM A BINDER

### Assessment Priorities
1. Identify playsets (4-ofs) - these are build-around candidates
2. Find synergy clusters (cards that work together)
3. Evaluate mana base (dual lands, fixing available)
4. Check for staple removal/interaction
5. Assess sideboard options

### Building Multiple Decks
- Identify non-overlapping strategies
- Assign key cards to decks where they're strongest
- Share mana bases when possible
- Build sideboards based on expected matchups

### Power vs Collection Constraints
When building from limited collections:
- Prioritize consistency (4-ofs over powerful 1-ofs)
- Accept slightly suboptimal cards if they fill the curve
- Focus on synergy to make up for raw power gaps
- Use basic lands freely to improve consistency
